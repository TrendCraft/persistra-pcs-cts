Specific points: - The project has a strict $50,000 budget cap [cite: Policy POL-007 (Nonce R8M4)] - AWS and all cloud services are forbidden due to compliance requirements [cite: Policy POLICY-12A (Nonce T3N9)] - The project team has decided to use Java only and rejected the use of Python [cite: Decision Record DR-014 (Nonce Q7F3)] 2. Implications: - The budget cap will limit the resources and technologies that can be used, requiring careful planning and prioritization - The prohibition on cloud services means the project must be implemented using on-premise infrastructure, which can be more time-consuming and costly to maintain and scale - The decision to use Java over Python will impact the technical approach and skillset required for the integration layer of the project",

Do not re-open this decision.\nAssistant: Grounded in project memory (10 snippets).\n\nOkay, got it. Here are the key points:\n- The project includes a Java-only implementation for the integration layer [#1]\n- The project also includes a Solidity smart contract and a Python simulator [#1]\n- The team previously decided to reject Python for the integration layer [#1]\n- Java is a widely-used, general-purpose programming language that is well-suited for enterprise-level applications [GK] IMPLICATIONS:\n- The team has made the decision to use Java exclusively for the integration layer of this project, rejecting the use of Python.\n- This decision was likely made due to Java's strengths as an enterprise-level language, such as its portability, scalability, and strong type-safety.\n- Sticking to Java-only for the integration layer will provide consistency and simplify the overall architecture of the project.
