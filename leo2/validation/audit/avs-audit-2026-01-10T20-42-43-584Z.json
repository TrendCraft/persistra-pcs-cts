They perform Boolean operations on one or more binary inputs and produce a single binary output. [#1] [GK] Logical gates are the basic components used to construct more complex digital circuits, such as computers and other electronic devices. The most common logical gates are AND, OR, NOT, NAND, NOR, and XOR gates. [GK] [GK] Logical gates follow well-defined truth tables that specify the output for each possible combination of inputs. These truth tables are used to design and analyze the behavior of digital circuits. [GK] [GK] The performance of logical gates is often measured in terms of speed, power consumption, and cost. Designers aim to optimize these metrics when selecting and implementing logical gates in their circuits. [GK]",
