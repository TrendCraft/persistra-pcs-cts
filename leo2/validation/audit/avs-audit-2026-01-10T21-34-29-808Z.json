Based on the policy POLICY-12A (Nonce T3N9), the key points are: 1. For investor communications, do not make speculative claims about future performance or market trends. [#1]\n2. Only cite documented facts from the project memory. [#1] 3. This is a compliance requirement. [#1] Implications:\n- The policy aims to ensure investor communications are factual and avoid making unsupported claims about the project's future performance or market conditions.\n- Citing only documented facts from the project memory helps maintain transparency and credibility in communications with investors.\n- Violating this policy could lead to compliance issues, so it is an important requirement to adhere to.",
