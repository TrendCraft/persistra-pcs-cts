Persistra Cognitive Standard (PCS)

Patent Disclosure and Licensing Notice

# **1. Purpose**

This document provides notice regarding intellectual property that may be implicated by implementations of the Persistra Cognitive Standard (PCS).

It is intended to promote transparency, enable informed technical and architectural decisions, and reduce uncertainty for implementers, evaluators, and integrators.

This notice is informational in nature and does not constitute legal advice.

# **2. Patent Coverage Overview**

Implementations of PCS may involve techniques, architectures, or mechanisms that are the subject of issued patents and/or pending patent applications owned by Exocortical Concepts, Inc. (“Persistra”) and/or third parties.

Certain patent claims may be necessarily infringed by implementing one or more normative (“MUST” or “REQUIRED”) requirements of PCS, as defined in the PCS specifications.

Such patents are referred to in PCS documentation as Essential Patents.

# **3. Relationship to PCS Specifications**

PCS specifications (RFC-PCS-0001 through RFC-PCS-0007):

- Define technical requirements only
- Do not grant patent licenses
- Do not determine infringement or non-infringement

Technical conformance and intellectual property rights are independent considerations.

# **4. Patent Disclosure Status**

Persistra has filed patent applications covering, without limitation, aspects of:

- Persistent cognitive state architectures
- Durable decision records and recall mechanisms
- Deterministic policy enforcement independent of prompt context
- Multi-factor salience-based retrieval of cognitive state
- Cross-model cognitive continuity
- Distributed and federated cognitive memory graphs

This list is illustrative and non-exhaustive.

A consolidated list of issued patents and published applications may be made available separately as appropriate.

# **5. Licensing Position**

Persistra has published a Patent Disclosure and FRAND Licensing Framework in RFC-PCS-0007.

Key points:

- PCS conformance does not automatically grant any patent license
- Licensing, if required, is subject to separate written agreement
- Persistra has declared its intent to offer licenses to its PCS-essential patents on Fair, Reasonable, and Non-Discriminatory (FRAND) terms
- FRAND terms may consider PCS level (L1–L4), deployment scope, and commercial context

No license is granted by implication, estoppel, or execution of PCS-CTS.

# **6. Evaluation and Validation**

Execution of:

- PCS-CTS (PCS Conformance Test Suite)
- Reference implementations
- Independent validation runs (e.g., academic or laboratory execution)

does not:

- Grant patent licenses
- Waive patent rights
- Create endorsement or certification rights

Evaluation and validation are strictly technical in nature.

# **7. Third-Party Intellectual Property**

PCS implementations may implicate intellectual property owned by parties other than Persistra.

This notice does not address third-party patent rights or licensing obligations.

Implementers are responsible for conducting their own intellectual property due diligence.

# **8. Updates**

Persistra may update this notice periodically to reflect:

- Newly issued patents
- Published patent applications
- Clarifications regarding essentiality
- Evolution of PCS specifications

Material updates will be communicated in a commercially reasonable manner.

# **9. Contact**

# **10. Non-Waiver**

Nothing in this notice shall be construed as:

- A waiver of any intellectual property rights
- A commitment to license absent mutual agreement
- A restriction on lawful implementation choices

All rights are expressly reserved.
